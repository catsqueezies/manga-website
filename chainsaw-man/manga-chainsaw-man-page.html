<!-- Introduction -->
	<p><strong> Chainsaw Man </strong>
	
	<br>Denji is a teenage boy living with a Chainsaw Devil named Pochita. Due to the debt his father left behind, he has been living a rock-bottom life while repaying his debt by harvesting devil corpses with Pochita.
	
	<br>One day, Denji is betrayed and killed. As his consciousness fades, he makes a contract with Pochita and gets revived as "Chainsaw Man" â€” a man with a devil's heart. </p>
